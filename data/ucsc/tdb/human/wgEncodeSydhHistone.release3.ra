# Notes:
#       - Track Long Label: Histone Modifications by ChIP-seq from ENCODE/Stanford/Yale/Davis/Harvard
#       - Track Short Label: SYDH Histone
#       - View Long Labels: [cell] [factor] Histone Modifications by ChIP-seq [view] from ENCODE/SYDH
#       - cellType Order: Ordering is based on tier and alphabetical within a tier
#   - Short Labels:
#		       Template: [cell] [factor]
#       - Cell: No abbreviations for cell
#       - Views: For consistency sake view will be two letters (View was removed as this is an optional label)
#		    - Peaks = Pk
#		    - Signal = Sg
#   - cellType Order: Ordering is based on tier and alphabetical within a tier.
#   - Default Tracks on: Peaks,Raw Signalsi for all cells and factors excluding inputs
#   - Display matrix:
#       - Tier 1 and Tier 2 cell lines have distinct labels that defining that their tier and distinct from cell names.
#		       - Dimension X - Factor
#		   - factor Order: Ordering is based on Histone Number then numerically and alphabetaclly. Numerically 09 before 12.
#		       - Dimension Y - Cell Type
#		       - cellType Order: Ordering is based on tier and alphabetical within a tier.
