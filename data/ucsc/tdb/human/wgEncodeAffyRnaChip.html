<H2>Description</H2>

<P>This track is produced as part of the ENCODE Transcriptome Project.

is compared in companion experiments using three different technologies: 
tiling arrays, RNA-seq using Solexa, and RNA-seq using SOLiD.  The
tiling array data are shown in this track. 


The <i> Transfrags</i> data are lifted over from the hg18 assembly. The <i>Raw Transfrags</i> are available for download only. Other views are available on the hg18 assembly.

<DT><i>Transfrags</i>
<DD>The filtered transfrags view excludes repeats and other known annotations 
including: 
tRNAs and rRNAs, mi/snoRNAs, things mapping to the mitochondrial or Y 
chromosomes, and many predicted snoRNAs and miRNAs.

<H2>Methods</H2>

<P>
Cells were grown according to the approved 
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" TARGET=_BLANK>ENCODE cell culture protocols</A>.
RNA molecules longer than 200 nt 
and present in RNA population isolated from different subcellular compartments 
(such as cytosol, nucleus, polysomes and others) were fractionated into polyA+ 
and polyA- fractions  as described in
<A HREF="/ENCODE/protocols/general/rnaExtracts.txt" TARGET=_BLANK>these
protocols</A>.
Each RNA fraction was converted into double-stranded cDNA using 
random hexamers, 
labeled and hybridized to a tiling 91-array set containing probes against the 
non-repetitive 
portion of the human genome tiled on average every 5 bp (center-to-center of 
each consecutive 25-mers). </P>

<P>All arrays were scaled to a median array intensity of 330. Within a sliding 
61 bp window 
centered on each probe, an estimate of RNA abundance  
was found by calculating the median of all pairwise average PM-MM values, 
where PM is a 
perfect match and MM is a mismatch. Kapranov <EM>et al.</EM> (2002), Cheng 
<EM>et al.</EM> (2005) , Kapranov <EM>et al.</EM> (2007), and Cawley 
<EM>et al.</EM> (2004) 
are good references for the experimental methods. Cawley <EM>et al.</EM> 
also describes the analytical methods.

<H2>Verification</H2>

<P>The reproducibility of the labeling method was assessed separately. Three 
independent 
technical replicates were generated from the same RNA pool for each RNA 
preparation and 
hybridized to duplicate arrays (two technical replicates) that contain the 
ENCODE regions. 
Labeled RNA samples were then pooled and hybridized to the tiling 91-array 
set spanning 
the whole genome. Transcribed regions (transfrags; see the <i>Raw Transfrags</i> 
view) were 
generated from the <i>Raw Signal</i> by merging genomic positions to which 
probes 
are mapped. This merging was based on a 5% false positive rate cutoff in 
negative 
bacterial controls, a maximum gap (MaxGap) of 40 base-pairs and minimum run 
(MinRun) 
of 40 base-pairs. </P>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
The track data were originally computed on the Human March 2006 assembly (hg18);
the coordinates of the Transfrags were transformed to this assembly using UCSC's liftOver
program.</P>
