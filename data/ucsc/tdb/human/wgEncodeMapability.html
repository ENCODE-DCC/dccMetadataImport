<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks display the level of sequence uniqueness of the reference <B>GRCh37/hg19</B>
genome assembly.  They were generated using different window sizes, and high signal
will be found in areas where the sequence is unique.

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
separated as separate (views). For each view, there are
multiple subtracks representing different sequence lengths or methods of preparation.
Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
<B>Mapability</B> tracks consist of the following views:
<DL>
<DT><I>Alignability</I></DT>
<DD>These tracks provide a measure of how often the sequence found at the particular
location will align within the whole genome.  Unlike measures of uniqueness, alignability
will tolerate up to 2 mismatches. These tracks are in the form of signals ranging from
0 to 1 and have several configuration options.</DD>
</P>
<DT><I>Uniqueness</I></DT>
<DD>These tracks are a direct measure of sequence uniqueness throughout the reference
genome. These tracks are in the form of signals ranging from 0 to 1 and have several
configuration options.</DD>
</P>
<P><DT><I>Blacklisted Regions</I></DT>
<DD>Both tracks of blacklisted regions attempt to identify regions of the reference
genome which are troublesome for high throughput sequencing aligners.  Troubled
regions may be due to repetitive elements or other anomalies.  Each track contains a
set of regions of varying length with no special configuration options.</DD>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<H4>Alignability</H4>
The <em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks display how uniquely k-mer sequences align
to a region of the genome. To generate the data, the GEM-mappability
<A HREF="http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net" TARGET=_BLANK>program</A> has
been employed. The method is equivalent to mapping sliding windows of k-mers
(where k has been set to 36, 40, 50, 75 or 100 nts to produce these tracks)
back to the genome using the GEM mapper aligner (up to 2 mismatches were
allowed in this case). For each window, a mapability score was computed
(S = 1/(number of matches found in the genome): S=1 means one match in the
genome, S=0.5 is two matches in the genome, and so on). The
<em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks were
generated independently of the ENCODE project, in the framework of the GEM
(GEnome Multitool) project.

<H4>Uniqueness</H4>
The <em>Duke Uniqueness</em> tracks display how unique each sequence is on the
positive strand starting at a particular base and of a particular length.
Thus, the 20 bp track reflects the uniqueness of all 20 base sequences with
the score being assigned to the first base of the sequence. Scores are 
normalized to between 0 and 1, with 1 representing a completely unique sequence 
and 0 representing a sequence that occurs more than 4 times in the genome
(excluding chrN_random and alternative haplotypes).  A score of 0.5
indicates the sequence occurs exactly twice, likewise 0.33 for three times
and 0.25 for four times. The <em>Duke Uniqueness</em> tracks were generated
for the ENCODE project as tools in the development of the
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeDNAseSuper">Open Chromatin</A>:
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">DNaseI HS</A>,
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromFaire">FAIRE</A>,
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">TFBS</A> and
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromSynth">Synthesis</A></B> tracks.

<H4>Blacklisted Regions</H4>
The <em>DAC Blacklisted Regions</em> aim to identify a comprehensive set of
regions in the human genome that have anomalous, unstructured, high
signal/read counts in next gen sequencing experiments independent of
cell line and type of experiment. There were 80 open chromatin tracks
(DNase and FAIRE datasets) and 20 ChIP-seq input/control tracks spanning
&#126;60 human tissue types/cell lines in total used to identify these regions
with signal artifacts. These regions tend to have a very high ratio of
multi-mapping to unique mapping reads and high variance in mapability.
Some of these regions overlap pathological repeat elements such as satellite,
centromeric and telomeric repeats. However, simple mapability based filters
do not account for most of these regions. Hence, it is recommended to use this
blacklist alongside mapability filters.  The
<em>DAC Blacklisted Regions</em> track was generated for the ENCODE project.

<P>
The <em>Duke Excluded Regions</em> track displays genomic regions for
which mapped sequence tags were filtered out before signal generation
and peak calling for
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeDNAseSuper">Open Chromatin</A>:
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">DNaseI HS</A> and
<A HREF="hgTrackUi?g=wgEncodeOpenChromFaire">FAIRE</A> tracks.
This track contains problematic regions for short sequence tag signal
detection (such as satellites and rRNA genes). The
<em>Duke Excluded Regions</em> track was generated for the ENCODE project.
