<H2>Description</H2>
<P>
These tracks display the level of sequence uniqueness of the reference mm9
genome.  They were generated using different window sizes and high signal
will be found in areas where the sequence is unique.


<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
This track contains multiple subtracks representing different cell types
that display individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring tracks
with multiple subtracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
</p>
<p>
These tracks provide a measure of how often the sequence found at the particular
location will align within the whole genome.  Unlike measures of uniqueness, alignability
will tolerate up to 2 mismatches. These tracks are in the form of signals ranging from
0 to 1 and have several configuration options.
</p>

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>
The <em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks show how uniquely k-mer sequences align 
to a region of the genome. 
By using the <A HREF="http://gemlibrary.sourceforge.net" TARGET=_BLANK>GEM mapper aligner</a>, 
where up to two mismatches were allowed, the method is equivalent to mapping 
sliding windows of k-mers back to the genome (where k has been set to 36, 40, 
50, 75 or 100 nucleotides to produce these tracks).
For each window, a mapability score was computed 
(S = 1/(number of matches found in the genome): S=1 means one match in the 
genome, S=0.5 is two matches in the genome, and so on). The 
<em>CRG Alignability</em> tracks were 
generated independently of the ENCODE project, in the framework of the GEM 
(GEnome Multitool) project.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
This is Release 1 (June 2012) of the ENCODE mapability track. It is a port of the old mapability track into the ENCODE format.
There are no new datasets.
