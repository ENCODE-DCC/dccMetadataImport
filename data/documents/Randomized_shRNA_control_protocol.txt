"Cells were transduced with a lentivirus expressing an shRNA containing a randomized DNA sequence generated by the siRNA Wizard v3.1 (http://www.sirnawizard.com/scrambled2.php) program. Lentiviral constructs also contained the puromycin resistance selectable marker and cells were treated 2 times, for three days each, to select for cells containing the retroviral construct."
