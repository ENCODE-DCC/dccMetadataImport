<H2>Description</H2>
<P><P>These tracks display a synthesis of evidence from different assays
as part of the four <B><em>Open Chromatin</em></B> track sets.
This track displays open chromatin regions and/or transcription factor binding
sites identified in
<A TARGET=ucscVocab HREF="/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?type=cellType">multiple cell types</A>
by one or more complementary methodologies: DNaseI hypersensitivity (HS)
(<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">Duke DNaseI HS</A>),
Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE)
(<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromFaire">UNC FAIRE</A>),
and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for select regulatory factors
(<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">UTA TFBS</A>).
Each methodology was performed on the same cell type using identical growth
conditions. (Note: Data for some or all ChIP experiments may not be available
for all cell types). Regions that overlap between methodologies identify
regulatory elements that are cross-validated indicating high confidence
regions.  In addition, multiple lines of evidence suggest that regions detected
by a single assay (e.g., DNase-only or FAIRE-only) are also biologically
relevant (Song <em>et al.</em>, submitted).
<P><A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">DNaseI HS data</A>:
DNaseI is an enzyme that has long been used to map general
chromatin accessibility, and DNaseI "hypersensitivity" is a feature of active
cis-regulatory sequences. The use of this method has led to the discovery of
functional regulatory elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers,
insulators, locus control regions, and novel elements. DNaseI hypersensitivity
signifies chromatin accessibility following binding of trans-acting factors in
place of a canonical nucleosome.
</P>
<P><A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromFaire">FAIRE data</A>:
FAIRE (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory
Elements) is a method to isolate and identify nucleosome-depleted regions of
the genome.  FAIRE was initially discovered in yeast and subsequently shown to
identify active regulatory elements in human cells (Giresi <em>et al.</em>,
2007). Similar to DNaseI HS, FAIRE appears to identify functional regulatory
elements that include promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, locus
control regions and novel elements.
</P>
<P><A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">ChIP data</A>:
ChIP (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation) is a method to
identify the specific location of proteins that are directly or indirectly
bound to genomic DNA. By identifying the binding location of sequence-specific
transcription factors, general transcription machinery components, and
chromatin factors, ChIP can help in the functional annotation of the open
chromatin regions identified by DNaseI HS mapping and FAIRE.
</P>
<P><A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">Input data</A>:
As a background control experiment, the input genomic DNA sample 
that was used for ChIP was sequenced. Crosslinked chromatin
is sheared and the crosslinks are reversed without carrying out the
immunoprecipitation step. This sample is otherwise processed in a manner
identical to the ChIP sample as described below. The input track is
useful in revealing potential artifacts arising from the sequence
alignment process such as copy number differences between the
reference genome and the sequenced samples, as well as regions of
poor sequence alignability.</P>

<H2> Display Conventions and Configuration </H2>
<P>This track contains multiple subtracks representing different cell types
that display individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring tracks
with multiple subtracks are
<A HREF="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" TARGET=_BLANK>here</A>.
<P>To facilitate analyses, each region has been assigned an <em>Open Chromatin Code (OC Code)</em>,
based on the assay(s) by which it was detected, and a color, based on its level of validation
(which was determined by the combination of its OC Code and its statistical significance):

<H2>Methods</H2>
<P>For each site, the maximum F-Seq Density Signal value has been calculated
for each assay that was performed in that cell type. F-Seq employs Parzen
kernel density estimation to create base pair scores (Boyle <em>et al.</em>, 2008b).
Significant regions, or peaks, were determined by fitting the data to a gamma
distribution to calculate p-values. Contiguous regions where p-values were
below a 0.05 (DNaseI HS, ChIP) or 0.1 (FAIRE) threshold were considered
significant. See assay specific description pages 
(<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromDnase">Duke DNaseI HS</A>,
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromFaire">UNC FAIRE</A> and
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg19&g=wgEncodeOpenChromChip">UTA TFBS</A>)
for more details.

<P>A Fisher's Combined P-value for DNaseI HS and FAIRE was calculated using
Fisher's combined probability test.  First, a test statistic is calculated
using the formula:</P>
<P>
<PRE style='font-size:1.2em;'>    <B>X<sup>2</sup> = -2</B><span style='font-size:2.6em;'>&#8721;</span><B>log<sub>e</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>)</B></PRE>
</P><P>
where <B><code style='font-size:1.2em;'>p<sub>i</sub></code></B> are the p-values calculated for DNaseI HS
and FAIRE.  <B><code style='font-size:1.2em;'>X<sup>2</sup></code></B> follows a chi-squared distribution,
thus a combined p-value can be assigned to this test statistic.
</P>
<B>Enhancer and Insulator Functional assays:</B>  A subset of DNaseI and FAIRE
regions were cloned into functional tissue culture reporter assays to test for
enhancer and insulator activity.  Coordinates and results from these
experiments can be found
