"CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) transcript levels were knocked down in cells using lentiviral transduction to express an shRNA targeting the CTCF gene. The lentiviral construct also contained a puromycin resistance selectable marker and cells were treated 2 times, for three days each, to select for cells containing the retroviral construct. By western blot, CTCF protein levels in the knockdown cells were <10% of cell lines transduced with a randomized shRNA lentiviral construct."
