<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
This track maps genome-wide human transcription factor binding sites using
second-generation massively parallel sequencing. This mapping uses expressed
transcription factors as GFP-tagged fusion proteins after bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) recombineering (recombination-mediated genetic engineering).
</p>

<p>
The University of Chicago and Max Planck Institute (Dresden) pipeline generates
recombineered BACs for the production of cell lines or animals that express fusion
proteins from epitope-tagged transgenes.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>

<p>
This track is a multi-view composite track that contains multiple data types
(<em>views</em>). For each view, there are multiple subtracks that display
individually on the browser. Instructions for configuring multi-view tracks
are <a href="/goldenPath/help/multiView.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
For each cell type, this track contains the following views:
<dl>
<dt><i>Peaks</i>
<dd>Regions of signal enrichment based on processed data (usually normalized data from pooled replicates).
<dt><i>Signal</i>
<dd>Density graph (wiggle) of signal enrichment based on aligned read density.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
Peaks and signals displayed in this track are the results of pooled replicate
sequence. Alignment files for each replicate are available for
<a href="/cgi-bin/hgFileUi?g=wgEncodeUchicagoTfbs" target="_blank">download</a>.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
Cells were grown according to the approved
<a href="/ENCODE/protocols/cell" target="_blank">ENCODE cell culture protocols</a>.
</p>

<h3>Recombineering Strategy</h3>

<p>
To facilitate high-throughput production of the transgenic constructs, the
program BACFinder (Crowe <em>et al</em>., 2002) automatically selects the
most suitable BAC clone for any given human gene and generates the sets of
PCR primers required for tagging and verification (Poser <em>et al</em>.,
2008). Recombineering is used for tagging cassettes at either the N or C
terminus of the protein. The N-terminal cassette has a dual eukaryotic-prokaryotic
promoter (PGK-gb2) driving a neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene within an
artificial intron inside the tag coding sequence. The selection cassette is
flanked by two loxP sites and can be permanently removed by Cre
Recombinase-mediated excision. The C-terminal cassette contains the sequence
encoding the tag followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in front
of the neomycin resistance gene. In addition, a short bacterial promoter (Gb3)
drives the expression of the neomycin-kanamycin resistance gene in <em>E. coli</em>.
</p>

<p>
The tagging cassettes, containing 50 nucleotides of PCR-introduced homology arms,
were inserted into the BAC by recombineering, either behind the start codon (for
the N-terminal tag) or in front of the stop codon (for the C-terminal tag) of the
gene. <em>E. coli</em> cells that had successfully recombined the cassette were
selected for kanamycin resistance in liquid culture.  Each saturated culture from
a specific recombineering reaction derived 10-200 independent recombination events.
</p>

<p>
Two independent clones were checked for each PCR through the tag insertion point and
97% (85/88) yielded a PCR product of the expected size. Most of the clones that failed
to grow were missing the targeted genomic region. An estimated 10% of the BACs used
were chimeric, rearranged or wrongly mapped. Thus, initial results indicated that the
necessary recombineering steps could be carried out with high fidelity.
</p>

<p>
The White lab produced all epitope tagged transcription and chromatin factor BACs,
as well as the genome-wide ChIP data and analysis.  An application of this approach
to the analysis of closely related paralogs (RARa and RARg) yielded transcription
factors, chromatin factors, cell lines, ChIP-chip data and ChIP-seq data (Hua
<em>et al</em>., 2009). Such paralogous transcription factors often cannot otherwise
be distinguished by antibodies.
</p>
 
<h3>Sample Preparation</h3>

<p>
ChIP DNA from samples were sheared to approximately 800 bp using a nebulizer. The ends of the DNA
were polished and two unique adapters were ligated to the fragments. Ligated fragments of
150-200 bp were isolated by gel extraction and amplified using limited cycles of PCR.
</p>

<h3>Sequencing System</h3>

<p>
Illumina GAIIx and HySeq next-generation sequencing were used to produce all ChIP-seq data.
</p>

<h3>Processing and Analysis Software</h3>

<p>
Raw sequencing reads were aligned using
<a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml" target="_blank">Bowtie</a> 0.12.5
(Langmead <em>et al</em>., 2009). The &quot;-m 1&quot; parameter was applied to suppress
alignments mapping more than once in the genome. Reads were aligned to the UCSC hg19 assembly.
Wiggle format signal files were generated with
<a href="http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/ChIP-seq/" target="_blank">SPP</a> 2.7.1
(Kharchenko <em>et al</em>., 2008) for R 2.7.1.
<a href="http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/MACS/index.html" target="_blank">MACS</a> 1.3.7
was used to call peaks. The MACS parameters used varied by experiment.
</p>

<p>
The White lab used goat anti-GFP antibody to perform ChIP in untagged K562 cells as a background control.
The test IP was performed in the same manner as the background control. Results were expressed as values
of the test normalized to the background.
</p>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>
This is Release 2 (July 2012) of this track.  It adds the targets BACH1, CCNE1, CDKN1B, ELF1, ESR, 
ILF2, MLL5, NCOR1, NF90 and STAT1. The new samples have 2 replicates and are not pooled. The newer
data contains q-values, has inputs available for display and does not have narrow peak calls. For
any questions regarding comparison of these datasets, please contact the submitting lab.
