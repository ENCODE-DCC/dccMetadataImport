Human_-_SUZ12_(05-1317)(Western_blot,ChIP-seq):human_SUZ12_validation_Bernstein.pdf 	ANTIBODY_DOCUMENT	SUZ12 (05-1317)   antibodyDescription   Mouse monoclonal A/G affinity purified recombinant protein corresponding to human SUZ12. Antibody Target: SUZ12   targetDescription   SUZ12 is a polycomb group (PcG) protein. PcG proteins act by forming multiprotein complexes, which are required to maintain the transcriptionally repressive state of homeotic genes throughout development. PcG proteins are not required to initiate repression, but to maintain it during later stages of development. They probably act via the methylation of histones, rendering chromatin heritably changed in its expressibility. This protein is component of the PRC2 complex, which methylates Lys-9 and Lys-27 residues of histone H3.

Antibody Target: TP53   targetDescription   This gene encodes tumor protein p53, which responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate target genes that induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. p53 protein is expressed at low level in normal cells and at a high level in a variety of transformed cell lines, where it's believed to contribute to transformation and malignancy. p53 is a DNA-binding protein containing transcription activation, DNA-binding, and oligomerization domains. It is postulated to bind to a p53-binding site and activate expression of downstream genes that inhibit growth and/or invasion, and thus function as a tumor suppressor. Mutants of p53 that frequently occur in a number of different human cancers fail to bind the consensus DNA binding site, and hence cause the loss of tumor suppressor activity. Alterations of this gene occur not only as somatic mutations in human malignancies, but also as germline mutations in some cancer-prone families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Multiple p53 variants due to alternative promoters and multiple alternative splicing have been found. These variants encode distinct isoforms, which can regulate p53 transcriptional activity.

Antibody Target: USF1   targetDescription   The ubiquitously expressed cellular upstream stimulatory factor (USF) consists of USF-1 and USF-2 polypeptides which independently exhibit site-specific DNA binding and are members of the c-Myc-related family of regulatory factors containing helix-loop-helix domains. USF also contains a leucine repeat that is required for efficient DNA binding. USF was originally identified as an up- stream stimulatory factor that binds the core sequence CACGTG in the adeno- virus late promoter. These findings, together with the demonstration of coop- erative interaction between USF and the initiator-binding protein, TFII-I, raises the possibility of a more general involvement of USF in transcriptional regula- tion. While expression of both USF-1 and USF-2 species is ubiquitous, different ratios of USF homo- and heterodimers are found in different cell types.

Antibody Target: EZH2   targetDescription   EZH2 (Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2, also designated Enx1 and SETDB1) is a human homolog of the Drosophila Polycomb-group protein Enhancer of Zeste protein. It contains a SET domain that catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (Histone H3 Lys27 monomethylated, dimethylated and trimethylated). Polycomb-group proteins repress gene expression by binding to chromatin and locally altering chromatin structure. EZH2, BMI-1 and Suz12 are present in the PRC2 and PRC3 protein complexes that function as mediators of epigenetic transcriptional silencing. EZH2 associates with the embryonic ectoderm development protein, the VAV1 oncoprotein, and the X-linked nuclear protein. EZH2 may play a role in the hematopoietic and central nervous systems. Deregulation of EZH2 is linked to a variety of cancers.

CDP (C-20) is an affinity purified antibody raised against a peptide mapping at the C-terminus of CDP of mouse origin. Antibody Target: CUX1   targetDescription   CDP (for CCAAT displacement protein) was identified as a repressor for tran- scription of developmentally regulated genes. It is a homeodomain protein that appears to compete with transcriptional activating proteins for binding to the promoter regions of various genes. CDP contains three cut repeats which function as DNA binding domains. It has been demonstrated that cut repeat domains have the capacity to bind to DNA in conjunction with or independently of homeodomain DNA binding. CDP has been shown to be the DNA-binding subunit of the HiNF-D complex, which contains cyclin A, Cdc2 and an Rb-related protein in addition to CDP. Histone expression is required for the transition to S phase in the cell cycle. The HiNF-D complex regulates the transcription of Histone H4, H3 and H1 genes, allowing cells to progress from G1 to S phase.

Antibody Target: E2F6   targetDescription   This gene encodes a member of the E2F transcription factor protein family. E2F family members play a crucial role in control of the cell cycle and of the action of tumor suppressor proteins. They are also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max. Multiple transcript variants have been reported for this gene, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that they encode valid isoforms (RefSeq).

Antibody Target: ZZZ3   targetDescription   ZZZ3 contains one ZZ-type zinc finger domain. ZZ type finger domains are named because of their ability to bind two zinc ions. These domains contain 4-6 Cys residues that participate in zinc binding (plus additional Ser/His residues), including a Cys-X2-Cys motif found in other zinc finger domains. These zinc fingers are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions -they are most likely involved in ligand binding or molecular scaffolding. The structure of the ZZ domain shows that it belongs to the family of cross-brace zinc finger motifs that include the PHD, RING, and FYVE domains.

Antibody Target: STAT5A   targetDescription   The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors. In response to cytokines and growth factors, STAT family members are phosphorylated by the receptor associated kinases, and then form homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription activators. This protein is activated by, and mediates the responses of many cell ligands, such as IL2, IL3, IL7 GM-CSF, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and different growth hormones. Activation of this protein in myeloma and lymphoma associated with a TEL/JAK2 gene fusion is independent of cell stimulus and has been shown to be essential for the tumorigenesis. The mouse counterpart of this gene is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which suggests the antiapoptotic function of this gene in cells. (provided by RefSeq)
